# WebDigger
WebDigger is a python based tool, specially created to get a company's unknown domain for pentestor.

Their are many domains of google, facebook, whatsapp etc. which are not indexed in any search engine. And if you try to ping them, the server will respond.
But the server are still there and working. These domains are specially created for other works.
For e.g. : whatsapp.net is not indexed anywhere, and if you ping this domain. You'll get an error.
And this whatsapp.net domain is used to make communications between whatsapp users.

WebDigger digs into whois database and using brute-force. It tries to find every single domain of a company.


Currently this tool is in beta stage. Need help in updating our database.

usage:-  ./webdigger.py

Hope this tool will help you. 

Happy Hacking :)
